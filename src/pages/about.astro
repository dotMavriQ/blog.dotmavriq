    <p>Hi, my name is Jonatan — though online I usually go by <strong class="text-gruv-yellow/90">dotMavriQ</strong>. My journey into tech started in the mid‑1990s when my father brought home a PC running Windows 95. I spent those early days exploring games, tinkering with software, and getting captivated by the early web.</p>
    <p>The real spark came when I discovered <em>Game Maker</em> on a magazine CD. That pushed me into making small interactive things and eventually into web development: first static XHTML pages, then more dynamic stuff with CSS and PHP. I cut my teeth on phpBB and adopted WordPress just before version 4.</p>
    <p>In college I built sites for local businesses and even received a silver service award for a web forum I coded from scratch. A formative traineeship at Nordic Goods exposed me to Ubuntu server setup, Magento deployments, and SEO‑aware site building. Linux has been a constant companion since—whether tuning servers or crafting developer tooling.</p>
    <p>Later at Ember and Duva I shifted from low‑code WordPress solutions to more full‑stack engineering: containers, Docker, early Kubernetes exposure, modern frontend stacks (Tailwind, React, TypeScript) and iterative delivery. I also served as President of Makerspace Lidköping for two years—helping the national org with web & tech initiatives and widening my perspective on community infrastructure.</p>
    <p>Subsequent roles (including IPTOR and Block Labs) refined my sense for pragmatic architecture, rapid application development, and the balance between velocity and maintainability. What drives me today is building systems that are understandable, observable, and evolve without fear.</p>
    <p>Outside of code: bass guitar, cooking, philosophy, trekking, reading, and time with my partner all keep me balanced.</p>
    <h2 class="mt-12 text-2xl font-bold text-gruv-blue">Now</h2>
    <p>I'm iterating on this site, streamlining personal tooling, and experimenting with lightweight content + publishing flows using Astro.</p>
