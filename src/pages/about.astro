        Hi, my name is Jonatan—though many online know me as <strong
          >dotMavriQ</strong
        >. My journey into technology began in the mid-1990s when my father
        brought home a computer, opening up an entirely new world for me. I
        still remember those early days with Windows 95—exploring games,
        experimenting with software, and becoming captivated by the emerging
        Internet.

        My passion for programming truly ignited when I stumbled upon Game Maker
        on a CD from a Swedish PC magazine. That discovery sparked a deep love
        for coding and creative digital experiences. Over time, this passion
        evolved into web development. I started by building simple, static
        websites in XHTML, soon expanding into more dynamic creations using CSS
        and PHP. I worked with phpBB early on and adopted WordPress just before
        it reached version 4.

        During my college years, I built websites for local businesses and
        earned a Silver Medal for Best Service at

        <a href="https://duva.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >Duva</a
        >, I transitioned from low-code WordPress solutions to Full-Stack
        Development. On the back end, I honed my skills with server technologies
        like Docker and Kubernetes. On the front end, I embraced modern
        frameworks such as Tailwind CSS, React, and TypeScript. I also served as
        President of Makerspace Lidköping for two years, contributing to the
        national organization (riksorganisation) with web and tech solutions.
        This role not only deepened my practical expertise but also expanded my
        network and strategic perspective. Later, I pursued further
        opportunities at
        <a href="https://iptor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

        RAD (Rapid Application Development).

        What drives me is a relentless curiosity and a commitment to delivering
        user-centered solutions that work. My diverse experience, combined with
        a genuine passion for technology, makes me a reliable
        problem-solver—someone who brings both technical expertise and a
        thoughtful, human approach to every project.
