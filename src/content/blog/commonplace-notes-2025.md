In my last post I went on about organized markdown notes, or rather, Obsidian, in my current case.

## Digital doesn't cover everything

But it doesn't REALLY solve every situation. You can't always sit and type into structured notes knowing exactly where your thoughts are supposed to go.

So I started looking into alternatives. A lot of people are comfortable doing this kind of thing in Obsidian too. A lot of people do things like [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), and if you don't know what that is there's a Wiki for it.

## Just get a notebook

But what works for me is just having a notebook handy. And just like my approach to never forgetting my wallet or my keys... I find it helpful if it's hefty, substantial, and singular.

I don't want to suddenly realize that "oh I didn't write that down in THIS notebook"... not everybody works like this, but I see it as me sticking to the [K.I.S.S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)-principle.

## The Milimetrado 1000

I have one notebook. In my case it's almost comedically big. I have the [Milimetrado 1000 Pages](https://www.curiosite.pt/produto/bloco-de-notas-de-estilo-vintage-com-1000-paginas.html). It really does have 1000 pages. It has "bible thin" pages that take surprisingly well to most pens, pencil or otherwise.

## How I actually use it

My process is honestly very simple. I jot down sketches, mind-maps, tons and tons of bullet lists for things I need to deal with or structure up later. Anything I need out of my head and into something I can go through at a later time. Another name for a [commonplace notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) is a brain dump, and that's really all it is.

It comes with a nifty little bookmark built into it, so you always know where the next fresh page is. That's about all I need from my notes, personally. It goes with me wherever I need to be for more than 5 hours.

Some days I just switch it up between checking boxes in the notebook and doing so in my Obsidian notes. The brain likes novelty, and switching things up keeps it from feeling like a chore.
