# CSS Grid vs Flexbox: When to Use What

When it comes to modern CSS layout, developers have two powerful systems at their disposal: Grid and Flexbox. But which one should you use, and when? Let's break it down.

## The Key Differences

### Flexbox: One-Dimensional Layout

Flexbox was designed for one-dimensional layouts - either a row OR a column:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row; /* or column */
}
```

It excels at:
- Distributing space among items in a single dimension
- Aligning items on a single axis
- Creating flexible elements that adapt to available space

### Grid: Two-Dimensional Layout

Grid was designed for two-dimensional layouts - rows AND columns simultaneously:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: auto;
}
```

It excels at:
- Creating complex grid-based layouts
- Precise placement of elements in both dimensions
- Creating gaps between elements

## When to Use Flexbox

Choose Flexbox when:

1. **You need a linear layout** (row or column)
2. **Content should drive the layout** rather than the other way around
3. **You're aligning elements** within a container
4. **Creating navigation menus** or toolbars
5. **Centering elements** vertically and horizontally

## When to Use Grid

Choose Grid when:

1. **You need a two-dimensional layout** with rows and columns
2. **The layout should drive the content** (not the other way around)
3. **Creating complex, grid-based designs** with precise control
4. **Building overall page layouts** with clearly defined regions
5. **Creating gap patterns** between elements is important

## They Work Great Together!

The beauty of modern CSS is that you can use both systems together:

```css
/* Grid for the overall layout */
.page-layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr;
  grid-template-areas: "sidebar main";
}

/* Flexbox for components inside the grid areas */
.navigation {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

## Real-World Example

Here's a common pattern that combines both:

```html
<div class="product-grid">
  <div class="product-card">
    <img src="product.jpg">
    <div class="product-info">
      <h3>Product Title</h3>
      <p>Product description here...</p>
      <div class="price-buy">
        <span class="price">$99.99</span>
        <button>Add to Cart</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- More product cards... -->
</div>
```

```css
/* Grid for the overall product layout */
.product-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}

/* Flexbox for the internal card structure */
.product-card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.product-info {
  flex: 1; /* Take remaining space */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.price-buy {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  margin-top: auto; /* Push to bottom */
}
```

## Conclusion

Neither Grid nor Flexbox is "better" - they're designed for different purposes. Understanding their strengths lets you choose the right tool for each layout challenge.

A good rule of thumb:
- **Think Flexbox** for components and one-dimensional layouts
- **Think Grid** for overall page structure and two-dimensional layouts

By mastering both, you'll have all the tools you need for modern CSS layouts!
