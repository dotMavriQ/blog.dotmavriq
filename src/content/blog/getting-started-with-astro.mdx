# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern static site builder that delivers lightning-fast performance with a developer experience you'll love. Let's explore how to get started with it.

## Why Astro?

Astro offers several advantages over traditional frameworks:

- **Zero JS by default** - Ship less JavaScript automatically
- **Component Islands** - A new web architecture for building faster websites
- **Server-first API design** - Move expensive hydration off of your users' devices
- **Edge-ready** - Deploy anywhere, even a global edge runtime like Deno or Cloudflare

## Setting Up Your First Project

```bash
# Create a new project with npm
npm create astro@latest my-astro-project

# Navigate to your new project
cd my-astro-project

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

Here's what a typical Astro project looks like:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

## Adding Integrations

One of Astro's strengths is its integration system:

```bash
# Add React components support
npx astro add react

# Add Tailwind CSS
npx astro add tailwind
```

## Deployment

Astro builds to static HTML by default, which means you can deploy to any hosting service:

```bash
# Build your site
npm run build

# Preview the build locally
npm run preview
```

That's it for the basics! Stay tuned for more advanced Astro tutorials.
