f:T869,<h3>Wowâ€¦ so itâ€™s 2025</h3>
<p>Web development feels like itâ€™s moving at light speed, and yet, somehow, weâ€™re still dealing with the same problems we had ten years ago.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve been at this for <em>a decade now</em>, mostly working with WordPress, and despite all the noise about Jamstack, headless CMSs, and the latest JavaScript frameworks, WordPress is still running a massive chunk of the internet. Market dominance aside, things at Automattic have been messy.</p>
<p>Mullenweg has been going off the rails, and yet, here I am, still writing custom themes, tweaking Gutenberg blocks, ACF, and making WP behave the way I want it to.</p>
<p>That said, Iâ€™ve been pushing myself beyond WordPress. I started really focusing on TypeScript in 2022, and after resisting it for years, I finally <em>get</em> why people love it.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s cleaner, more predictable, and actually helps prevent dumb mistakes. Laravel has also pulled me back into PHP, and honestly? Itâ€™s been fun. PHP has always had a bad reputation, but Laravel makes it feel modern and structured in a way I wish JavaScript frameworks did. Why isnâ€™t there a Laravel for JS with real industry traction?</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve also put a ton of time into a productivity plugin, something that fits the way <em>I</em> work. If I polish it enough, I might release it, but for now, itâ€™s been a great way to push my skills.</p>
<p>Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into an Advanced Google Tag Manager course on Udemy, which has been eye-opening in ways I didnâ€™t expect. Also, after years of putting it off, I <em>might</em> finally finish Harvardâ€™s CS50. Ever since I first heard about it way back when, Iâ€™ve wanted to complete it, and it feels like the right time to finally make that happen.</p>
<p>So yeah, thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m at. AI is changing how we write code, but fundamentals still matter. Web dev is weird and chaotic, but if you actually take the time to <em>learn</em>, youâ€™ll be fine. More posts coming soon. Or not. Weâ€™ll see.</p>
<p>Anyways welcome to my blog!
I hope to hear from anyone willing to take the time to read my ramblings and observations.</p>
