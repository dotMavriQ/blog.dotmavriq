# Getting Started with Next.js: A Practical Guide

Next.js has become one of the most popular frameworks for building React applications. It combines the best of both server-side rendering and static site generation, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of web projects.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides:

- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- File-based routing
- API routes
- Built-in image optimization
- And much more!

It's developed by Vercel and has gained tremendous popularity due to its developer experience and performance benefits.

## Setting Up Your First Next.js Project

Let's walk through creating a basic Next.js project:

### 1. Create a new project

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
```

During setup, you'll be asked several questions about your preferred configuration:

- TypeScript support
- ESLint integration
- Tailwind CSS
- App Router vs Pages Router
- And more

Choose based on your project needs.

### 2. Explore the project structure

A typical Next.js app router project will have:

```
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
├── public/
├── .eslintrc.json
├── next.config.js
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json (if using TypeScript)
```

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Creating Pages and Routes

Next.js uses a file-based routing system. For the App Router:

- `app/page.tsx` becomes the root route (/)
- `app/about/page.tsx` becomes the /about route
- `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` becomes a dynamic route like /blog/my-post

## Data Fetching

Next.js provides several ways to fetch data:

### Server Components (in App Router)

```jsx
// app/posts/page.tsx
async function getPosts() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts')
  return res.json()
}

export default async function Posts() {
  const posts = await getPosts()
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Styling in Next.js

Next.js supports various styling methods:

1. **CSS Modules**: `styles/Home.module.css`
2. **Global CSS**: Import in `app/layout.tsx`
3. **Tailwind CSS**: Pre-configured in new projects
4. **CSS-in-JS**: Libraries like styled-components

## Deployment

Next.js applications can be deployed to various platforms:

- **Vercel**: One-click deployment, optimized for Next.js
- **Netlify**: Great for static sites
- **AWS, GCP, Azure**: For custom cloud deployments

## Conclusion

Next.js provides an excellent developer experience with powerful features out of the box. This guide just scratches the surface of what's possible with Next.js.

In future posts, I'll dive deeper into advanced Next.js concepts like:

- Server Components vs. Client Components
- Advanced routing
- API routes
- Data fetching patterns
- Performance optimization
