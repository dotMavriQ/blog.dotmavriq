### Wow… so it’s 2025

Web development feels like it’s moving at light speed, and yet, somehow, we’re still dealing with the same problems we had ten years ago. 

I’ve been at this for *a decade now*, mostly working with WordPress, and despite all the noise about Jamstack, headless CMSs, and the latest JavaScript frameworks, WordPress is still running a massive chunk of the internet. Market dominance aside, things at Automattic have been messy.

Mullenweg has been going off the rails, and yet, here I am, still writing custom themes, tweaking Gutenberg blocks, ACF, and making WP behave the way I want it to.

That said, I’ve been pushing myself beyond WordPress. I started really focusing on TypeScript in 2022, and after resisting it for years, I finally *get* why people love it. 

It’s cleaner, more predictable, and actually helps prevent dumb mistakes. Laravel has also pulled me back into PHP, and honestly? It’s been fun. PHP has always had a bad reputation, but Laravel makes it feel modern and structured in a way I wish JavaScript frameworks did. Why isn’t there a Laravel for JS with real industry traction?

I’ve also put a ton of time into a productivity plugin, something that fits the way *I* work. If I polish it enough, I might release it, but for now, it’s been a great way to push my skills.

Recently, I’ve been diving deep into an Advanced Google Tag Manager course on Udemy, which has been eye-opening in ways I didn’t expect. Also, after years of putting it off, I *might* finally finish Harvard’s CS50. Ever since I first heard about it way back when, I’ve wanted to complete it, and it feels like the right time to finally make that happen.

So yeah, that’s where I’m at. AI is changing how we write code, but fundamentals still matter. Web dev is weird and chaotic, but if you actually take the time to *learn*, you’ll be fine. More posts coming soon. Or not. We’ll see.

Anyways welcome to my blog! 
I hope to hear from anyone willing to take the time to read my ramblings and observations.
