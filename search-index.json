Five days in the Finnish capital in the dead of winter. We booked the flights in early January, still shaking off what had been an absolutely brutal flu. Getting There The flight from Lisbon was long. Around five hours. We didn't manage to get seats together, so Margarida and I ended up trying a Bluetooth mesh chat app to message each other across the cabin, which made me unreasonably happy in a nerdy way. We landed at about 22:30 local time. After the Uber to Hotel Helka we were starving and the options were slim. Most of Helsinki was asleep. But we found a savior in the night: Ristorante Mirella, a short walk from the hotel. We thought we'd been coaxed into a bar with misleading information, but no, the service was a good step above average, the staff were genuinely kind, and even the drunk guests were joyful and giving us recommendations. I had a pizza nduja, Margarida had a porcini risotto with parmesan and a martini. We would've preferred something quintessentially Finnish for our first meal, but for what it was, it lifted our spirits completely. We tried lonkero back at the hotel. The original grapefruit flavor and a cranberry one. It's a Finnish institution. A gin-based long drink that dates back to the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, originally created by the state alcohol company Alko to serve the influx of foreign visitors. Refreshing, uncomplicated, and dangerously easy to drink. Work Days For the working portion of the trip we moved to Hotel Jugend, which was closer to the office. The library lounge there was beautiful. All dark wood and soft lighting, the kind of space that makes you want to sit down and actually focus. Meeting my Nordhealth colleagues in person was the highlight. These are people I'd been collaborating with through screens for months, and putting faces to names in a real room is always worth the trip. One of the nights we had a site launch coming in hot, so I ended up at my laptop until two in the morning crunching code. Not glamorous, but satisfying in that particular way where you and the team just push through it together. While I worked, Margarida went solo and found Restaurant Kannas, where she had a fillet sirloin of reindeer. I was jealous. Walking Helsinki The non-work days belonged to the city. Helsinki in January is cold, bright, and covered in snow. We walked everywhere. The city is compact enough that you can cover most of the center on foot, and the snow made everything feel quieter and more deliberate. We started at Senate Square and the Helsinki Cathedral, that massive white neoclassical church that dominates the skyline. The views from the top of the steps, out over the square and the Alexander II statue), were stunning in the winter light. From there we walked down to Kauppatori, the market square by the harbor, and then up the snow-covered stairs to Uspenski Cathedral, the largest Orthodox church in Western Europe. The red brick against the white snow was something. We passed by the Elias Lönnrot statue, now buried in snow. Lönnrot compiled the Kalevala, Finland's national epic, from oral folk poetry. The statue felt appropriately solemn under a blanket of white. We walked through Esplanade Park, past St. John's Church, and found the \"Fact & Fable\" statues along the way. The Food Finnish food surprised me. At Cafe Engel, right on Senate Square, Margarida had chocolate marble cake and I had apple cake with vanilla custard, washed down with Finnish apple ciders that tasted like champagne. But the real discovery was the Karelian pirogi, a traditional rye-crusted pastry filled with rice porridge, served with egg butter. Delicious. One of those things where you immediately understand why it's survived centuries. Restaurant Sea Horse) was the quintessential Helsinki experience. A legendary spot that's been open since 1934. I had sautéed reindeer with lingonberries and mashed potato. My first proper reindeer dish. It was rich, gamey, tender, everything you want from a Nordic staple. For dessert they brought out leipäjuusto, Finnish \"squeaky cheese,\" a baked cheese that actually squeaks against your teeth when you bite into it. Served warm with cloudberry jam. Unforgettable. We also found Cafe Succes and had a semla, the Scandinavian cardamom bun filled with almond paste and whipped cream. A tradition I know well from my years in Sweden, but no less enjoyable for it. RAGU The best meal of the trip was Restaurant RAGU. Four courses. First: rainbow trout served sushi-style with delicate toppings. Then a moose ragu with polenta and red kale, rich and deeply savory, the kind of dish that makes you close your eyes for a second. The main was whitefish with a potato cake, roasted carrot, carrot cream, and hollandaise. And to close: a deconstructed piña colada with coconut vanilla ice cream, fresh pineapple, and cookie crumble. Every plate was beautiful and every bite was considered. RAGU earned its reputation. Earlier that evening we'd stopped by Henry's Distillery for gluten-free beers. Margarida's eternal quest. And they delivered. The Art We spent a morning at Ateneum, Finland's national art museum. Two pieces stuck with me. One was Akseli Gallen-Kallela's The Horn of the Huntsman (Metsämiehen torvi) from 1911, a painting rooted in Finnish mythology and the Kalevala tradition. Bold strokes, deep forest tones, the kind of national romantic work that makes you understand why Finland holds its folklore so close. The other was a detail from Gustav Klimt's Beethoven Frieze. Seeing Klimt's goldleaf work up close, the texture and precision of it, is a different experience than any reproduction can offer. Heading Home We flew back through Copenhagen, because of course we did. Margarida grabbed Mikkeller at the airport. At this point it's a tradition. The woman cannot pass through CPH without a Mikkeller in hand, and I respect the commitment deeply. Five days wasn't enough. Helsinki has a quiet confidence to it, a city that doesn't shout for your attention but rewards you for paying it. The architecture, the food, the culture, the snow. We barely scratched the surface. Next time we'll stay longer."},{"slug":"goodbye-firefox","title":"Goodbye Firefox","excerpt":"After years of holding on, I finally dropped Firefox.","tags":["Switching To","Digital Freedom","Consumer Rights"],"date":"2026-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","body":"The first time I used Firefox was on my family's Windows 98 machine. I don't remember how I found it. Probably a recommendation from a forum or a friend at school. But I remember what it felt like. Internet Explorer was all I knew at that point, and it was miserable. Slow, ugly, riddled with toolbars nobody asked for, and seemingly allergic to rendering anything correctly. Firefox was a revelation. It was fast. It had tabs. It felt like the browser wanted you to use the web, not fight with it. I was hooked immediately. Firebug and the love affair What really cemented it, though, was Firebug). If you weren't around for it, Firebug was a Firefox extension created by Joe Hewitt) that essentially invented browser developer tools as we know them. Before Firebug there was nothing. You wrote HTML and CSS and if something looked wrong you stared at the source until your eyes bled. Firebug gave you a live DOM inspector, a CSS editor that updated in real time, a JavaScript console, a network tab, the works. It was magic. I can trace a direct line from Firebug to me falling in love with web development. Being able to see what was happening, to poke at the DOM and watch things change, that's what made the web feel like a playground instead of a black box. Every browser's DevTools today, from Chrome to Safari, is a descendant of what Firebug started. It was that important. The Chrome shift Then Google Chrome showed up in September 2008 and everything changed. Chrome was fast. Not incrementally fast, not \"a bit snappier\" fast. It was a different league. The V8 JavaScript engine) was built from the ground up for speed, with just-in-time compilation that made JavaScript execution feel instant compared to what Firefox's SpiderMonkey was doing at the time. Each tab ran in its own process, so one bad page didn't take down the whole browser. The UI was minimal to the point of being almost invisible, all screen real estate given to the web itself. And it wasn't just speed. Chrome's developer tools were excellent from the start, clearly inspired by Firebug but integrated natively and iterated on aggressively. The extension model was cleaner. Updates were silent and automatic. Everything about it felt like a product built by people who understood what both users and developers actually wanted from a browser. Firefox responded, but slowly. Their multi-process architecture, Electrolysis, took years to ship and arrived long after Chrome had made process-per-tab the baseline expectation. The Quantum) rewrite in 2017 was genuinely impressive, a massive overhaul of the rendering engine with components written in Rust), and it made Firefox feel competitive again for a while. But the pattern was always the same: Chrome shipped something, Firefox caught up a year or two later, and by then Chrome had already moved on to the next thing. The last independent engine Here's the thing that still matters, though. Firefox runs on Gecko), and it is now the only relevant browser engine that isn't Chromium). Think about that for a second. Chrome, Edge, Opera), Brave), Vivaldi), Arc), Samsung Internet, all of them run on Blink>), which is Google's fork of WebKit. Safari) runs on WebKit itself, which shares deep roots with Blink. That leaves Gecko. Alone. Google controls Blink. Google controls V8. Google effectively sets the pace for what the web can do and how it does it. The Chromium project is open source, yes, and that provides some protection, but \"open source\" doesn't mean \"open governance.\" Google's engineers drive the roadmap. Google's priorities shape the features. If Google ever decides, whether through financial pressure or strategic interest, to push the web in a direction that serves its ad business at the expense of openness, there's barely anyone left to offer an alternative rendering of the same page. That's not a healthy ecosystem. That's a monoculture. So why am I leaving Because Firefox has been making it really hard to stay. Standards keep arriving late. The selector, arguably the most significant CSS addition in years, shipped in Chrome 105 in August 2022 and didn't land in Firefox until December 2023, over a year later. CSS Container Queries shipped in Chrome 105 alongside but Firefox didn't get them until Firefox 110 in February 2023, months behind. The View Transitions API? Chrome shipped it in early 2023. Firefox still has it behind a flag heading into 2026. The Popover API, the Navigation API, CSS Anchor Positioning, all of them arrive in Firefox late or not at all. If you're building for the modern web, you are building for Chromium first and hoping Firefox catches up eventually. That's a terrible position for a browser that claims to champion the open web. The AI debacle. In mid-2024, Mozilla started bolting AI features onto Firefox. First came the AI chatbot sidebar in Firefox 130, letting users pipe page content to ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or other providers directly from the browser. Then they announced Mozilla.ai, a startup spun up to build \"trustworthy AI.\" They revised their privacy policy in ways that made people nervous about data usage, though they later walked back some of the language. And they rolled out an AI-generated \"recommended stories\" feature on the new tab page through their Pocket) integration. The community response was immediate and harsh. This is Mozilla. The organization whose entire identity is built on privacy, user agency, and an open web. And they were chasing the same AI trend that every tech company was stumbling over itself to ship, not because users were asking for it, but because the industry decided it was the next gold rush. The forums filled with people asking why engineering resources were going toward chatbot sidebars instead of fixing the actual browser. It felt like a betrayal of priorities, and it was. Android is broken. I don't know how else to put this. Firefox on Android is genuinely painful to use. Pages stall mid-load for no discernible reason. Tabs freeze and refuse to respond to input. Sometimes the entire app just... stops. Not a crash. It doesn't close. It just stops doing anything, sitting there with a blank stare until you force-close it and reopen it. I've lost count of how many times I've had to kill the app just to get it to ping again. The GeckoView rewrite was supposed to be the foundation of a better mobile Firefox, and on paper it was a solid architectural move, but in practice the experience is rough. It's been years and it still feels like a beta. Any one of these I could live with. All three together? I'm done waiting. Vivaldi So I'm moving to Vivaldi). Vivaldi was founded in 2016 by Jon von Tetzchner, the same guy who co-founded Opera back when Opera was actually good. The premise is simple: build a browser for people who care about how their browser works. It's Chromium under the hood, so you get full compatibility with the modern web and the Chrome extension ecosystem. But the shell around that engine is where it diverges completely. Tab stacking. Tab tiling. A built-in mail client, a feed reader, a calendar. Customizable keyboard shortcuts for everything. Command palette. Configurable toolbars. A notes panel. Web panels that let you dock any site into a sidebar. Mouse gestures. Page actions. Custom CSS theming. It's the power-user browser that Firefox used to feel like back in the extension golden age, except the features are native and they actually work. The company is based in Oslo, self-funded through search partnerships, and they've been vocal about not tracking users, not selling data, and not chasing trends. No AI gimmicks. No crypto wallets. Just a browser that respects the people using it. What I'm not saying I don't hate Mozilla. I don't hate what Firefox represents. The Mozilla Foundation still funds important work in internet health, privacy advocacy, and open standards. MDN Web Docs is one of the best resources on the internet and I use it often. Gecko existing at all is a net positive for the web. But Mozilla's funding reality casts a long shadow. Roughly 80% of Mozilla Corporation's revenue comes from a search deal with Google. That's the same Google whose browser dominance is the primary threat to the open web. It's a dependency that makes Mozilla's independence feel more symbolic than structural. If that deal shrinks, or ends, what's left? And in the meantime, the browser itself is falling behind in ways that matter to the people who actually build the web. I've held on for years. I evangelized Firefox to friends, family, and colleagues. I filed bugs. I donated. I ran Nightly builds. But faith needs something to hold onto, and right now Firefox isn't giving me enough. So it's Vivaldi for a while. Maybe a long while. And I'll keep one eye on Gecko, hoping it finds a second wind. Who knows what the future holds."},{"slug":"porto-2025","title":"Porto 2025 (Wardruna)","excerpt":"Wardruna in Porto.","tags":["Slice of Life","Travel"],"date":"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","body":"A couple of months back Margarida bought a costly set of front row tickets to see one of my all time favorite bands, Wardruna, at Casa Da Música in Porto. Best gift I could ask for. Getting There We took an early morning Uber on not that much sleep. My stomach was raw and warbly even before we got on the train. The ride itself was a bit more turbulent than I'm used to, but the highlights included seeing more of what this beautiful country has to offer from the window. I nearly knocked my front teeth out in some luggage obstacle course between wagon 6 and wagon 3 just to grab a small glass of juice. Walking Porto When we arrived I wanted to use my feet, so we walked for well over an hour. At one point I met a guy who looked down on his luck - he asked me for some cash to buy diapers for his kid. I obliged. We ended up at Mel, this quaint Nordic-inspired fika spot in Porto that just happened to be open even though it was a holiday. I had a Swedish cider while Margarida had her coffee. After a little snack we took an Uber to our hotel, conveniently placed close to the venue. Wardruna We were quite beat from the early morning and the slightly rough travel, so I took a shower and we took a long nap before ordering some Mexican takeaway. Then we went to the venue. And what can I say about Wardruna? I've seen them twice before - once in Stockholm and once in Gothenburg - and they were possibly even better this time around. This was their World Tour 2024/2025 and the setlist was stacked. They opened with Kvitravn and moved through Hertan, Skugge, and Solringen before Heimta Thurs. Lyfjaberg hit different live. They played the skaldic version of Völuspá, then Tyr, Isa, Grá, Himinndotter, Birna, and Rotlaust tre fell. Fehu built up into Helvegen towards the end - and, as per usual, my eyes were glassy. They closed the encore with Hibjørnen. Fantastic set, fantastic roster of songs performed. Possibly the best I've seen them. The Walk Back It rained on us as we headed back to the hotel, and then we couldn't enter the room because the smart lock app decided to stop working. The owner had to sprint over and fiddle about and re-calibrate the lock. Did our ancestors starve and struggle only for this to be our new norm? The Day After It rained the next day too. Margarida had to take a business trip from Porto up to Braga, so I worked from the hotel room. I decided to skip lunch entirely to make room for a late dinner at Café Santiago - home of the legendary francesinha. Somewhere in the ballpark of 1,500 to 2,000 kcal of pure indulgence and it tasted very, very good. I'd brought the Sony along so I also took some artsy pictures of Porto before heading back on the third. What a trip."},{"slug":"reflecting-on-two-years","title":"Reflecting on Two Years","excerpt":"Two years since moving to Portugal. Looking back at what changed.","tags":["Slice of Life"],"date":"2025-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","body":"So it's been two years since I left Sweden for Portugal, huh? Wow. Time flies. A lot of things have happened since. The good and the bad. The Bad The bad is navigating my field in the age of AI. \"AI itself\" is not the culprit, but I would definitely be lying if I said that I haven't noticed, even among peers, that AI has a profound impact on how developers are managed. It has warped expectations, pushed juniors below the surface, cranked expectations on seniors. We are all generalist expert ICs all of a sudden, ownership scope widens, the days of mindful approaches are limited to product... for web it's often an afterthought. I've been playing around a whole lot since GPT-3 and tested every hyped model out there. And there are great benefits to leveraging AI for my field, for sure. But the caveats are these oscillations in corporate approaches... It feels quite scary that corporations put that amount of faith in what is in the end a data-sucking, lambda-throttled SaaS from a private company that might not have your company's best interest in mind. The code you generated with it, or even gave access to scrape, might be incredibly similar to what your competitor gets their hands on when they crank up the gas bill and try to compete with you. There's also been a lot of health scares with the family of my loved one. And I haven't even met anyone except my mom, my dad and two friends since I left Sweden... I'd like to be able to take a proper vacation and visit as soon as possible. Guess I'm also bummed that the weather is starting to give out over here. I'm not cut out for the winters here. Won't even comment on politics, the economy or the geopolitical situation. If you're 100 years into the future reading this, I bet even you have a clear picture of the time in which this was written... The Good Well the good part is that me and Margarida are super-close with getting our house plans in order. We have the money for it, the bank statements, we are doing all we can to find the home of our dreams and I sense that at any moment we'll finally move into the house of our dreams. And things are good with me and Margarida. We can weather whatever comes our way. I hope that I'll spend 2026 in our own home. That my parents will be able to visit, that I'll stick with the job I have and that the trajectory is going up and not down across the board."},{"slug":"got-my-dap","title":"Got my DAP","excerpt":"After many years of supporting Spotify, I am switching back to a regular audio player. Here are my personal motivations.","tags":["Slice of Life","Switching To","Digital Freedom","Consumer Rights"],"date":"2025-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","body":"I got Spotify very early. I was still in college. I might have even installed it on my very first smartphone, the HTC Wildfire. It beat the convenience of piracy and for a long time it was lauded for exactly that. No more torrenting, no more sketchy downloads. Just press play and it's there. And it caught me. The slow frustration But even in the very beginning it was frustrating. You'd spend hours crafting the perfect playlist, building something that told a story from track to track, and then one day you'd be listening and something just felt off. A track was skipped. You check, and there it is: \"This song is no longer available in your region.\" Gone. No warning, no explanation, no alternative. Just a greyed-out line where your favorite song used to be. This happened over and over again, for years, across every playlist I cared about. And every time it stung a little more. You will own nothing Here's the thing about streaming: you don't own anything. Not a single track. You're renting access to a catalog that can be altered, reduced, or removed at any time and you have zero say in it. The phrase \"you will own nothing and be happy\" has become a meme at this point, but when it comes to digital media it's literally what happened. We went from a world where you bought a record, a tape, a CD, a digital file, and it was yours forever, to a world where you pay a monthly fee for the privilege of maybe hearing what you want to hear today. DRM makes sure you can't keep any of it. Cancel your subscription and everything vanishes. Every last song. That's not ownership. That's a lease with terrible terms. What it does to artists And it's not just bad for listeners. It's atrocious for the people making the music. Spotify pays somewhere between $0.003 and $0.005 per stream. In 2024, they introduced a 1,000-stream threshold below which artists don't get paid at all. That policy alone reportedly withheld around $47 million from small independent artists and redistributed it to bigger acts. Meanwhile, the platform has been caught filling playlists with stock music from ghost artists to reduce royalty payouts. Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter found that around twenty songwriters were behind the work of more than five hundred fake \"artists\" whose tracks had been streamed millions of times. Spotify calls this \"Perfect Fit Content.\" Everyone else calls it what it is. And then there's the CEO, Daniel Ek, pouring $702 million into AI-powered combat drones) while songwriters can't pay rent. Artists have been leaving the platform in droves throughout 2025. Massive Attack, King Gizzard, and a growing wave of indie musicians have all pulled their catalogs. The algorithm got me But honestly? What actually broke me wasn't the politics or the payouts. It was what the algorithms did to my listening habits. I used to take music VERY seriously. I was the guy digging through obscure bands, buying records at shows, building my taste one discovery at a time. That's who I am. But Spotify's recommendation engine is patient. At first it was just annoying. Redundant pop artists showing up in my Discover Weekly, easy to ignore. But over time it built a profile on me. It figured out the kind of pop it could market to me specifically. And it kept pushing it into custom playlists, over and over and over again, until the last couple of years I realized I'd just been stuffing myself with vapid muzak. Background noise dressed up as personal taste. I no longer felt like the rebellious counterculture person who cared deeply about what I listened to. Yet I know I still am that person. The algorithm just buried him under a mountain of curated mediocrity. The DAP So I put my foot down and bought a DAP. The FiiO Snowsky Echo Mini in cyan. It's a tiny dedicated music player with dual CS43131 DAC chips, both 3.5mm and 4.4mm balanced#4.4mm) outputs, support for DSD256 and 24-bit/192kHz FLAC, a microSD slot for up to 256GB, Bluetooth 5.3, and about 15 hours of battery life. It looks like a tiny cassette player. It cost less than $50. It plays the files I put on it. No algorithm, no recommendations, no \"This song is no longer available.\" Just music. The quirks It's not perfect. You can't scrobble from it. It doesn't even keep an internal listening history. That might show up in a firmware update someday, but for now you're flying blind on stats. A man can dream. The other thing is that you need to load albums using software because the player sorts files inside folders by \"date added.\" If you just throw files in there haphazardly it'll jumble your albums into an incoherent mess. Annoying thing to have to be mindful about, but you learn the workflow. Paying for music again And yes, I pay for music now. When the news broke that Tomas \"Tompa\" Lindberg died in September 2025, I went straight to Bandcamp and bought Live The Storm by Disfear. Tompa was the vocalist of At The Gates, one of the most important melodic death metal bands to ever exist, and his run with Disfear produced some of the best d-beat punk ever recorded. That album was recorded by Kurt Ballou at God City Studios. It's perfect. Tompa was 52. Buying that record felt right in a way that adding it to a playlist never would have. Support the ecosystem Bandcamp is the best thing that's happened to independent music in years. Artists get the majority of the sale. You get a file you own forever. No DRM, no subscription, no disappearing tracks. It's how buying music should work. And if you care about tracking what you listen to, ditch Last.fm and move to ListenBrainz. It's open source, community-driven, and ties into MusicBrainz, which is the most comprehensive open music database out there. Use these tools. Explore music with hunger. Dig for things that algorithms would never show you. Slow down. Be conscious about what you listen to. Own your music. The artists making it deserve that much, and so do you."},{"slug":"alicante-2025","title":"Alicante 2025 (Nordhealth)","excerpt":"Sun, tapas, and unexpected discoveries along the Costa Blanca.","tags":["Slice of Life","Travel"],"date":"2025-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","body":"Nordhealth flew us all out to Alicante for the company offsite. This was the big one - meeting everybody in person for the first time. I'd already met the marketing team in Copenhagen about a month earlier, but this was the full roster. Engineers, designers, product people, the lot. Getting There I met up with Nikolaj, Ricardo and Pedro at the airport before the flight down. The flight in was beautiful - coming down along the Costa Blanca coastline you get that classic Mediterranean postcard moment, deep blue water against dry, sun-bleached land. I knew immediately that sunscreen was going to be important. Spoiler: I did not act on this knowledge. We grabbed a cab from the airport to the hotel together, and from there it was just a steady stream of faces I'd only known through screens. I met my new manager Andrea, my good friend Naresh, Ryan, and I finally got to meet my teammate David in person. I met Fred and Arunas - the legend. And eventually my roommate for the duration, Giorgios. The Offsite The days were packed. Work sessions, talks, and all the in-between conversations that make these trips worthwhile. The highlight on the talks side was a security lecture by Cezary - genuinely impressive stuff about software security. I'd say about 20-25% flew over my head, but that's what you'd expect from someone that well-versed in the field. The kind of talk where you walk away feeling both smarter and more aware of how much you don't know. There was also a meditation class led by Siddhartha, who had flown in all the way from India. I joined in, and afterwards got to talk to him and ask him some questions, which I'm grateful for. And then there was the karaoke. Most of it was what you'd expect, but one guy decided to go full brutal death metal. And he could belt. Genuinely hilarious and genuinely impressive at the same time. Beyond the scheduled stuff it was just lots of drinks, walking around with newfound colleagues, and getting to know people. Happy to meet Philip, the designer. Joana, who aided in arranging the whole thing. And Karan, the CEO, of course. The food was great every night, but one dessert stood out - a bread pudding type deal topped with an ice cream that had hints of smoke, rich deep sugars, and dulce de leche. One of those dishes where you stop talking mid-sentence because your brain needs a moment. Castillo De Santa Barbara On the last day a group of us - the gang - took a walk up to Castillo De Santa Barbara. We took the lift up to the castle entrance and hiked around from there. The views over Alicante and the coastline were stunning, and they had medieval armor on display inside which was a nice bonus. Filip was shade-maxxing for most of it, which was the smart move. I, on the other hand, did the entire walk without sunscreen, like an authentic idiot. Frittata mode: engaged. Heading Home I picked up some turrón at the airport - my in-laws had asked for it. Nikolaj, Ricardo, Pedro and I were all on the same flight back to Portugal, which was nice until we almost lost Nikolaj to the boarding process. Thankfully it didn't have to play out like that and we all made it back safe. Short trip, but dense. For once I'm working for a company with people I genuinely like, doing work I can manage well. Meeting everyone face to face confirmed what I'd been feeling over screens for months - these are good people. Between Copenhagen and Alicante, I've now had two trips with Nordhealth colleagues in the span of a month, and both left me feeling like I ended up in the right place."},{"slug":"denmark-2025","title":"Denmark 2025","excerpt":"A few days in Denmark, hygge and all.","tags":["Slice of Life","Travel"],"date":"2025-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","body":"Margarida and I spent a week in Copenhagen this August. Part work trip, part vacation, all hygge. We stayed at Tivoli Hotel in Vesterbro. Day 1 - Arrival We flew in on Thursday the 14th. After landing we didn't waste much time before finding a tap room at the airport and immediately going for a nice cold Mikkeller. Margarida had been waiting years for this. Day 2 - Museum Day We started Friday with a swim in the hotel pool and a session in the sauna, really enjoying ourselves before heading out. The rest of the day was dedicated to museums. We started with Nationalmuseet, where we wandered through everything from Viking-era wooden carvings and medieval gilded altarpieces to African sculptures, Japanese samurai helmets, and ornate Renaissance interiors. There was also this massive sculpted face that was striking. Between museums we stopped at Pods of Beans, a highly rated organic cacao and chocolate spot nearby. Margarida had a coffee, I had a Naturfrisk Solbær, and we shared some date balls. After that we walked over to Krigsmuseet (the War Museum). They had a \"Droner i Krig\" (Drones at War) exhibit alongside the permanent WWII occupation collection - resistance radio equipment, code sheets, uniforms, weapons. There was a particularly interesting section about the Denmark-Sweden wars of the 1560s and how it ended in status quo despite enormous casualties on both sides. For lunch we went to Husmanns Vinstue, a proper old-school Danish place. I decided to be brave and ordered leverpostej - served with crispy bacon, rugbrød, and pickled cucumber, washed down with a Jacobsen beer. I'm not a frequent consumer of liver, but this was honestly the best dish I've ever had with liver in it. One extra point for Denmark. That night we ate at Warpigs - brisket, mac'n'cheese, and a good set of Mikkeller beers, of course. Day 3 - Parents, Frikadeller & Is Med Guf Saturday was special. Earlier in the day we walked along the waterfront boardwalk out to Den Lille Havfrue (The Little Mermaid). My parents traveled to København just to see us, and we met up with them. Just getting to talk with them was the highlight of the whole trip. After spending time together we grabbed is med guf - ice cream with \"guf\", which is this uniquely Danish thing where they top your cone with a fluffy, marshmallow-like foam made from whipped egg whites and sugar, usually pink and strawberry-flavored. Think of the inside of a flødebolle scooped out and plopped on top of your ice cream. It's one of those things that only exists in Denmark and you just have to try it. For lunch I got to try danske frikadeller for the first time. They were delicious - served with potatoes, beetroot, and parsley sauce on these beautiful old-fashioned patterned plates. That evening I had a steak with fries, broccolini and pepper sauce. Later we went to the Mikkeller bar on Viktoriagade - the original one - to round off the night. Day 4 - Walking the City Sunday was a walking day. Started with a fruit bowl at a cafe, then out exploring. We walked along the waterfront past the Tycho Brahe Planetarium. Right around there, a younger guy called out to us from the side of the street. We decided to humour him and looked over. He excused himself profusely and explained that he was the bartender at the bar nearby and had accidentally locked himself out - he was stuck in the locked-off garden area. We had to go into the bar and follow his voice until we could let him back in. That doesn't happen every day. We ducked into Vor Frue Kirke to see the neoclassical interior, browsed a board game shop, found an incredible comic book store, and stopped by Duck Haven on Strøget (the rubber duck store, naturally). Lunch was biksemad - the classic Danish hash with a fried egg, beetroot, and rugbrød, paired with a Brooklyn Brewery beer. Walked past the Christian X equestrian statue at Kongens Nytorv, popped into a Nordic Health shop, and just kept going until our legs gave out. Dinner was burgers and fries at a spot with Jagger and Kølster drinks. Sometimes you just need a cheeseburger. Day 5 - Work + Team Dinner Monday was partly a work day. Quick lunch - a baguette with arugula and a Faxe Kondi. The evening was the real treat: dinner with the entire Nordhealth BU Marketing team. Lena, Helena, Camilla, Trine, Claire, and Candice were all there - everybody but David. Margarida got invited by Lena, and I'm so grateful to have her as my manager. We had green soup with basil and croutons, grilled eggplant with sesame on hummus and naan. Good food, better company. Day 6 - Heading Home Tuesday was departure day. Margarida picked up a couple of Mikkeller Space Race cans at the airport, because of course she did. Mikkeller has been her absolute favorite ever since she first tried their gluten-free beer at Mellbygatans in Lidköping years ago. The Unfinished Gauntlet We made a \"Danish food and culture gauntlet\" list before the trip - things we wanted to eat and do while we were there. We didn't finish it. We never got to try koldskål, the classic Danish summer treat - cold buttermilk with kammerjunker biscuits and fresh berries. It's seasonal and we just ran out of days. We also missed æbleskiver, but those are really a winter thing so we'll save that for another time. Either way, with Margarida's re-ignited desire for Mikkeller, I know it won't be too long before we visit you again, København."},{"slug":"nos-alive-2025","title":"NOS Alive '25 (Muse & Nine Inch Nails)","excerpt":"Muse and Nine Inch Nails at NOS Alive. One of the best nights.","tags":["Slice of Life"],"date":"2025-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","body":"Me and Margarida had been waiting for this one for months. We bought our tickets the moment Nine Inch Nails were confirmed on the NOS Stage. One of our all-time favorite bands, finally live, together. Getting there NOS Alive takes place at Passeio Marítimo de Algés, right on the waterfront in Oeiras. We took the Cascais Line train to Algés station, which is about a five-minute walk from the entrance. Easy enough. What wasn't easy was the queue. We stood in the sun for a good while before we finally got our wristbands stamped and made it through the gates. But we were in. The first thing that hit me was how LOUD the place was. Louder than most Swedish concerts I've been to, and I've been to some loud ones. Because I'm a gentle flower I had brought ear protection. Margarida thought it was funny. My eardrums did not complain. The kebab situation We went on a skirmish to find food. I went with a kebab roll. Now, I need to say this: it was nowhere near the beauty and art that is proper street food kebab from the Västra Götaland region of Sweden. That's my regional pride talking and I will not apologize for it. But it was definitely worth eating. What I will complain about is that it was criminally small, which is something that almost never happens when you buy food in Portugal. Usually the portions here are absurdly generous. This was the exception. Wandering We walked around and heard bands playing faintly from various stages but nothing grabbed us enough to stick around. We had talked about potentially catching Amyl & The Sniffers or Foster the People (yeah, for that one song) but we decided against it and just saved our energy for the two acts we actually came for. Muse Muse) were stepping in for Kings of Leon who had to cancel due to lead singer Caleb Followill needing emergency surgery. Not a bad replacement. They opened with Unravelling into Hysteria) and right there you're reminded that Chris Wolstenholme is one of the most underrated bass players in rock. That Hysteria bassline live is a different animal. Distorted, relentless, driving the entire song while Matt Bellamy does his thing on top. It's a bass riff pretending to be a guitar riff and it sounds enormous in an open-air setting. Stockholm Syndrome) came early and Bellamy threw his guitar into the air and then into his amp at the end. Classic Muse chaos. They ran through Psycho, Kill or Be Killed, Plug In Baby, Time Is Running Out), Supermassive Black Hole). All bangers. Chris wore a Portuguese national team shirt with the name and number of Diogo Jota, the Liverpool and Portugal forward who had died in a car accident in Spain just nine days earlier at age 28, along with his younger brother. The whole crowd recognized it. It was a heavy moment in the middle of a loud show. They closed the encore with Starlight). A good set. Wolstenholme held it down the whole way through. Nine Inch Nails After Muse we grabbed some water and waited. The main event. Trent Reznor walked on stage dressed head to toe in black with combat boots and they opened with Acid, Bitter and Sad into Somewhat Damaged) into Wish) into Mr. Self Destruct. Those first four tracks set a tone that was just unreal. Relentless, abrasive, physical. The kind of opening that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. The bass on Mr. Self Destruct live is something else. That pulsing low end fills every inch of open air and you feel it in your chest before you hear it with your ears. Alessandro Cortini on synths and bass duties alongside Robin Finck on guitar and Ilan Rubin on drums. This lineup is absurdly tight. March of the Pigs hit like a truck. Piggy brought it down to something tender. The Lovers from the newer material sat well next to Reptile, which is a ten-minute monster that builds and builds until the bass and drums lock into this groove that just crushes. Closer) needs no introduction. The whole crowd knew every word. The Perfect Drug was a surprise and its bass-heavy groove hit differently in person. They covered Bowie's I'm Afraid of Americans, which Trent originally collaborated on and which felt especially pointed given the current state of things. Every Day Is Exactly the Same, Burn, The Hand That Feeds, Head Like a Hole. One classic after another. And they closed with Hurt). Just Trent and that song. The whole arena went quiet. Before leaving the stage, Trent made some comments suggesting he might leave the US and move to Portugal. Please do, Trent. We'll take care of you. The walk back On the way out I grabbed another one of those kebabs to compensate for the first one being so small. Priorities. We were ecstatic. Both of us just buzzing, talking about the set, walking through the scattered crowds still lingering around the area. People sitting on curbs, groups laughing, the whole post-festival atmosphere. It was a vibe I didn't know I had missed. Just being out among people after a loud night, sharing that energy with strangers who all saw the same thing you did. The train ride home was more of the same. Just talking to Margarida about the set, about which songs hit the hardest, about how long we'd waited for this. Seeing NIN together, finally, after all the times we'd listened to those records side by side. It hit different. One of the best nights we've had."},{"slug":"zavial","title":"Zavial: Part Two","excerpt":"Birthday in the Algarve. Fish, books, and Moroccan radio.","tags":["Slice of Life","Travel"],"date":"2025-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","body":"Margarida and her family had planned to celebrate my 33rd birthday in lovely Zavial, down in the Algarve near Vila do Bispo. This is the second time we go. Hence the \"pt 2.\" Prep chaos The days before were a scramble. Dia de Portugal gave me a mellow holiday that I spent coding Astro), eating grilled salmon and a cheese platter. The next day I had two errands to knock out before leaving: grab a MiFi dongle from CascaiShopping and get a haircut. Margarida coaxed me into the new barbershop there. Osmar cut me and dare I say he did an excellent job. Might even go for the beard care next time. I was also sweating over whether my shipment of snus would arrive before the 13th, because if not I'd have thrown 90 euros at something that would get sent back while I was in the Algarve. It arrived. Crisis averted. Getting there Margarida and her family are an adventurous bunch. We packed until 2 in the morning and at 05:00 we were already out of bed to beat traffic. We brought poor little Matilde the cat this time as she hasn't been feeling too well. She meowed a lot at first since she's not used to being transported, but she eased into it towards the end. We stopped for a quick breakfast around 09:00. Margarida and I went with the gluten-free gila melon cake, which is a Portuguese thing you should try if you haven't. By 11:11 we greeted Hermenegildo and Isilda, our hosts. If anyone ever wants to visit Zavial, I highly recommend renting rooms from them. Genuinely kind people. Day one I immediately felt like napping for an undisclosed amount of time, but the team had other plans. We went straight to a nearby restaurant where I inhaled a burger and two bottles of Why Not Organic Soda with peach and ginger flavor. Love that stuff. After that I excused myself and took a nap until 18:00. Then I set up the Vodafone MiFi dongle I'd bought specifically for this trip so I could work remotely without hunting for WiFi in a town that probably doesn't have a library. Web dev that does sysadmin things needs more than 40 gigs of mobile data, so the MiFi was the move. That evening me and Margarida played some Ring Fit Adventure (yep, we brought it), showered, talked, laughed at Moroccan FM radio bleeding through from across the strait, and read books until bed. The Algarve is close enough to North Africa that you pick up their stations. It's a fun detail. Birthday June 14th. I turned 33. We celebrated with Carlos and Xana and I asked that we keep it mellow. We popped a bottle of Moët, courtesy of Margarida, and ended up falling asleep on the sun chairs for a moment. Not a bad way to spend a birthday. The food We grilled a lot of fish throughout the stay. Dourada, robalo, pregado. We also grilled some great pork. Ate at our favorite nearby restaurant, A Sagres, twice. We took a short trip to Lagos to buy some traditional sweets and look at the bay. I had a double cherry Magnum). No regrets. The vibe A lot of this trip was just... being there. Catching sun. Having drinks. Reading Dune) until my eyes hurt. The little bar nearby with the almond-flavored drinks. Swimming in the ocean. Sitting on the rocks. Looking at the cliffs. There's not a lot of phone signal down there and that's part of the charm. You slow down because there's nothing to scroll. The days stretch out. You eat when you're hungry, nap when you're tired, and the biggest decision is whether to go to the beach before or after lunch. Coming home The day before we left, me and Margarida went for a walk with the camera to take some pictures of the area. A proper goodbye to Zavial until next time. Then we drove home, went to IKEA in Alfragide, burned an insane amount of money, and I had daimtårta). Bought Dumle and potatischips and some kitchen stuff. We were there for something like four hours. Been over two years since I touched down on Swedish soil at that point. Starting to miss it, especially the people. But Zavial is a pretty good consolation prize."},{"slug":"ring-fit-adventure","title":"Ring Fit Adventure","excerpt":"Using Ring Fit Adventure as an actual workout routine. Does it hold up?","tags":["Slice of Life","Health"],"date":"2025-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","body":"Since moving to Portugal, and living in a shared situation with the in-laws, being a small town boy in a city environment, working remotely... I have certainly become more unhealthy than I ever was in my 20s. Not with diet so much, but definitely with physical movement. The remote work body It hasn't gotten to the point where I've gained weight. But I can feel it some nights. Lumbar, shoulders. The consequences of crappy posture and horrible ergonomics stacking up quietly. Sitting in front of a screen all day and then sitting in front of a different screen all evening doesn't do your spine any favors. I've also walked my entire life. Back in Sweden that was just how you got around. But here, because Margarida goes shopping with her mom, I just tend not to have the incentive to get out and hit my 4-6000 daily steps anymore. The walks that used to be built into my routine simply disappeared. Enter Ring Fit Margarida was about to get a gift from me. I had bought the Nintendo Switch for her and my first instinct was another game, but I wanted it to align more with her recent ambitions. She already works out like a monster, five or more times a week. So Ring Fit Adventure felt like the move. This way we could connect around something physical together and I could actually play with her instead of just watching. What I didn't expect was how much I'd end up playing it on my own. How it works The game comes with a Ring-Con (a flexible resistance ring) and a leg strap, both housing Joy-Con controllers that track your movements. You strap in and run through a full RPG adventure where exercises ARE your attacks. The story is absurd in the best way. You team up with a sentient Pilates ring to defeat Dragaux, a bodybuilding dragon with an ego the size of his biceps, across 20+ worlds and over 100 levels. It's goofy. It knows it's goofy. That's fine. Combat is turn-based. When enemies show up, you attack by performing exercises. Squats, overhead presses, knee-to-chests, yoga poses, bow pulls, planks. Each exercise is color-coded: red for arms, blue for legs, yellow for core, green for yoga. Enemies are color-coded too, so matching your exercise to the enemy type deals extra damage. It's a simple system that forces you to diversify your workout whether you want to or not. When enemies attack back, you defend by pressing the Ring-Con into your abs and holding. Sounds easy. It isn't after 20 minutes. The workouts that actually hurt The game tracks \"active time\" separately from total play time, so it knows exactly how long you've been exercising versus navigating menus or watching cutscenes. A 15-20 minute active session can take close to an hour of total play time, and you WILL be sweating by the end. The ab exercises are brutal. Anything that involves sustained Ring-Con presses will have your core burning. Planks and mountain climbers are rough. But the real killers are the tree poses. Balancing on one leg while pushing and pulling the Ring-Con sounds simple until you're ten reps deep and your standing leg is shaking. The difficulty goes from 1 to 30. Higher difficulty means more reps per exercise and tougher enemies, so battles take longer and you work harder. It scales well. What felt challenging at difficulty 15 becomes your warm-up at 22. There's also a quiet mode that replaces running in place with squats, which is a nice touch when your in-laws are in the room below. Not a miracle worker I'm not going to pretend this replaces a gym or proper strength training. It doesn't. But what surprised me is just how well the gamification works. The leveling system, the smoothie crafting, the gear upgrades, the feeling of clearing a world boss after a tough session. It triggers the same part of my brain that any good RPG does, except I'm actually moving. The convenience factor is huge. No commute, no membership, no scheduling. Just grab the Ring-Con and play for 20 minutes. For someone who has been steadily declining in physical activity for years, removing every possible excuse has been more effective than any amount of guilt or good intentions ever was. Staying with it I like it. I hope to stick with it. The goal is to finish the entire adventure on the hardest difficulty. Stay tuned for that. It's not going to turn me into an athlete, but it gets me moving on days I otherwise wouldn't, and it does it in a way that doesn't feel like a chore. For a game about fighting a dragon by doing squats, that's more than enough."},{"slug":"wordcamp-lisboa-2025","title":"WordCamp Lisboa 2025","excerpt":"My first WordCamp. Merch, talks, and good people.","tags":["Slice of Life","WordPress"],"date":"2025-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","body":"I touched my first WordPress page before 2008 and I've stumbled upon WordPress sites at every single place I've worked since. It's the thing that just keeps showing up no matter what direction my career takes. Leaning my CV to highlight just how much WordPress I'd actually been doing is what got me my first job here in Portugal. At this point I must be close to having worked with it for a decade. So when WordCamp Lisboa 2025 was announced right here in my city, there was no excuse left. Day one In typical Jonatan fashion I didn't really prep that much for day one. I just showed up. But it was cool either way. I spent most of the time getting a feel for the grounds, figuring out where things were, grabbing some merch. I watched people doing community contributions and workshopping, all that good stuff. It was enough to get a sense of the vibe and I left feeling stoked about coming back for day two. When I got home I wolfed down an Uber Eats order from one of my favorite nearby places, Nicolau, and then spent some time with Dune) which I had just started reading for the first time in my life. Felt inspired to actually try contributing to the WordPress community myself. The energy at the event was that kind of contagious. Day two Day two was the real one. I ended up hanging out with the people over at WidgiLabs. Raul, Bruno, Nuno and a bunch of others made me feel right at home, which is not a small thing when you're walking into a community event alone for the first time. I attended a mix of English and Portuguese presentations. The Portuguese ones were a good exercise for me too, being that I'm still improving my language skills. The talks ranged from technical deep dives to community building and everything in between. The merch situation I got tons of merch. Stickers, pins, bags. The WordCamp merch game is strong and I was not above hoarding. Why it mattered There's something about being in a room with people who care about the same tools you use every day. I've spent years working with WordPress in various capacities and it can feel like a solitary thing when you're just sitting at your desk pushing code. Meeting people who build plugins, design themes, run agencies, or just blog with it was a good reminder that there's a whole community behind the software. Probably not my last WordCamp is all I can say."},{"slug":"ghost-2025","title":"Ghost 2025 (MEO Arena)","excerpt":"Ghost at MEO Arena, Lisbon. The Skeletour.","tags":["Slice of Life"],"date":"2025-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","body":"I've been a fan of Ghost) since I found their first record. I think I actually discovered Opus Eponymous around the time Infestissumam came out, so I was a little late but not by much. What sold me Tracks like Con Clavi Con Dio and Ritual sold me on the soundscape immediately. It's proto-heavy metal. It takes cues from the Arthur Brown) school of \"I AM THE GOD OF HELLFIRE\" theatrics and filters it through Blue Öyster Cult riffs and Satanic liturgy. And I know there's discourse online about the campiness being a problem, but to me it's very clearly deliberate and it's half the charm. Ghost would be a worse band if they took themselves completely seriously. Tobias Forge deserves his flowers What I appreciate about Tobias Forge is the path he took to get here. This isn't some guy who stumbled into a gimmick. He played live guitar for Onkel Kånkel at some point, a tasteless Swedish punk act that translates roughly to \"Uncle Dingle and His Dingleberries.\" He fronted Repugnant) under the alias Mary Goore, a proper Stockholm death metal band that put out demos in the early 2000s and only got their debut album Epitome of Darkness released posthumously in 2006. That record is legitimately great death metal. Then there was Subvision, an indie rock project that almost had him take a completely different path. They recorded a full album, had press releases out, and the whole thing just fell through. If that record had landed, we might never have gotten Ghost. The man has street cred. He just chose to dress it up in papal robes and write songs your mom could hum. Meliora is still the one Meliora) was and still is my favorite Ghost record. The songwriting on that album is on another level. Cirice alone won them a Grammy, and rightfully so. From the Pinnacle to the Pit is basically a funk riff dressed in metal clothes. That track was apparently written on a bass, and as a bass player I believe it, because the low end drives that song harder than the guitars do. So hearing those songs live was something I'd been waiting for. The Skeletour Ghost played the MEO Arena in Lisbon on April 29th 2025 as part of the Skeletour World Tour. Papa V Perpetua was the frontman this time around, allegedly the fraternal twin of Papa Emeritus IV. Classic Ghost lore. They opened with taped intros of Jan Johansson's Klara Stjärnor and Allegri's Miserere Mei, Deus before kicking into Peacefield and Lachryma from the new Skeletá record. But the Meliora block was the highlight for me. Spirit into From the Pinnacle to the Pit, then later Devil Church into Cirice, then He Is, and closing the main set with Mummy Dust. Six songs from one album scattered across the set and each one hit. What surprised me was how much the live versions improved songs from albums I hadn't connected with as strongly before. Prequelle tracks like Rats and Dance Macabre have a different energy in an arena. Same with Call Me Little Sunshine from Impera. Those records clicked for me in a way they hadn't at home. Speaking of Impera, that album had Fredrik Åkesson from Opeth playing all the guitars in the studio. And honestly, you can hear it. The lead work on that record has a precision and flair that goes beyond what Ghost had done before. Mikael Åkerfeldt also played acoustic guitar on the Prequelle instrumental Helvetesfönster. The Opeth connection runs deep and it makes total sense when you hear it. The bass and the keytar The Nameless Ghouls did their thing. The bass had that thick, dirty tone Ghost is known for live and it sat perfectly in the mix on songs like From the Pinnacle to the Pit and Mummy Dust, where the low end really carries the groove. But the moment that got me was the Ghoul on keytar. There's something about watching a masked figure in robes shredding a keytar that just works. It's ridiculous and awesome in equal measure. The keyboard parts on songs like Year Zero and Cirice went from background texture to a proper spectacle when performed on a keytar front and center. Hendricks and the phone pouches Before the show we hit a Gin & Tonic stand sponsored by Hendrick's. They had some limited edition variety on offer. We got these big glasses so we kept it at one each and just enjoyed each other's presence for a moment before the chaos started. A really nice way to start the evening. At the door they gave everyone Yondr pouches for their phones. You keep the pouch but it's locked until you leave. I was skeptical at first but honestly? It works. It completely changes the atmosphere. Almost everyone in the crowd had their hands up instead of holding a screen. People actually watched the band. Eyes on the stage at all times. It felt like going to a show in 2005 again, before everyone started experiencing concerts through a 6-inch rectangle. I think more bands should do this. A good night I had a fantastic evening with my partner. Ghost put on one of those shows where you walk out buzzing and keep talking about it on the drive home. Meliora tracks live, new songs from Skeletá that actually hold up, and just enough theatrics to remind you that this is a band that understands showmanship without letting it overshadow the music. They closed the encore with Square Hammer and the whole arena sang along. Hard to beat that."},{"slug":"the-blackout","title":"The Blackout","excerpt":"The day the power went out across Portugal and Spain.","tags":["Slice of Life"],"date":"2025-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","body":"The Portuguese call it the Apagão. \"Apagar\" means to turn off, to extinguish. \"Apagão\" is the big one. The great turning off. On April 28th 2025, at around 12:33 local time, the entire Iberian Peninsula lost power. Spain, Portugal, parts of southern France. Gone. A cascading failure in the Spanish grid knocked out roughly 15 gigawatts of generation in seconds. The whole system collapsed within 20 seconds. How it played out I was at home in Alcabideche when it happened. The power just cut. No flicker, no warning. Just off. Out of sheer coincidence I happened to be on the phone with Margarida, who was at work, when it went out. That meant we knew right away that it hit both places, and they're far apart. So before most people had even figured out it wasn't just their building, I had already pieced together that this was something bigger. I still had some mobile data in those first minutes, so I jumped into the Facebook group PortugalSvenskar and posted about it. That ended up giving me enough visibility that Swedish state television reached out wanting an interview. I declined. I didn't feel like I represented the typical Swedish expat experience here, being that I live with Portuguese natives and wasn't exactly stranded at a resort somewhere. Also, if I'm being honest, I just didn't feel like being on national television. After that, coverage dropped completely. No data, no calls, nothing. The phone was a brick. You're just sitting there in silence with no information, no idea how long it'll last. The first real bits of info came from neighbors talking to each other. Old school. Hours passed. Power started coming back in patches across the country throughout the evening. Portugal actually restored faster than Spain, with most of the grid back within about 12 hours. But those first hours of total silence were something else. The Lidl expedition Eventually we decided to go to Lidl to grab some essentials. What we found was eye-opening. The store was running on backup power, but the generators only supplied the non-refrigerated sections. The refrigerated aisles were blocked off with plastic sheeting. People were peeking behind the plastic, reaching in, grabbing what they could. The staff were trying to stop people from buying products they technically weren't allowed to sell since the cold chain was broken. Some people just went to the self-checkout to bypass the staff entirely. The bread aisle was completely empty. And I mean NOTHING. The only thing left across the whole aisle was three lone bone-dry wafers with dark chocolate. That's it. People had taken all the wine. All the bottled water except the most expensive flavored stuff that nobody ever buys. The long-storage shelves were picked through too. Everything gone except the crappy tuna that nobody wants even on a good day. One store. A few hours. That's all it took. The aftermath The power came back. Life went on. But something had shifted in my head. I immediately placed an order for solar-powered power banks, a HAM radio, a 10 liter water bag with a dispenser, and a handful of other things that would probably get me labeled a prepper if I listed them all. I don't think I'm overreacting. We saw how fast the shelves emptied. We saw how useless our phones were without cell towers. We saw how a single point of failure in a power grid hundreds of kilometers away can turn your afternoon into a survival exercise. What you should actually have at home Growing up in Sweden, every household used to receive a government pamphlet called Om krisen eller kriget kommer (\"If crisis or war comes\"). It was originally a Cold War thing, discontinued in 1991, then brought back in 2018 because the world didn't get less complicated. The 2024 edition recommends that every household should be able to manage on their own for at least a week. After the Apagão I went through that checklist properly for the first time. Here's what I'd consider the essentials: Water and food Bottled water, at least 3 liters per person per day. Freeze some of it. Frozen water doubles as cooling for your fridge if the power goes out, and becomes drinking water as it thaws. Canned goods, dried pasta, rice, crackers, energy bars. Stuff that doesn't need a fridge or a stove. A manual can opener. Sounds obvious until you're standing there with a can of beans and no way to open it. Light and power Flashlights with spare batteries. At least one per room you actually use. Candles and matches or a lighter. A solar-powered power bank or two. Your phone is your lifeline for information if the cell towers come back before the grid does. Health Basic first aid kit. Bandages, antiseptic, tweezers, scissors. Over-the-counter medications: painkillers, anti-diarrhea, antihistamines, any prescription meds you rely on with a buffer supply. A thermometer. Communication and information A battery-powered or hand-crank radio. When the internet is gone and your phone is dead, FM radio is the only thing still broadcasting. Cash in small bills. Card terminals don't work without power. Important documents in a folder you can grab: ID, insurance, medical info. Warmth Blankets. More than you think you need. Warm clothing layers accessible even in summer. Buildings cool down fast. None of this is paranoid. It's just practical. The Apagão lasted less than a day and people were already fighting over bread and water at the supermarket. A week-long disruption and most households would be in real trouble. It doesn't take a disaster movie scenario. It just takes one bad afternoon to realize how thin the line is between normal life and \"we should have had a plan.\""},{"slug":"cognitive-load-theory","title":"Cognitive Load Theory","excerpt":"Your brain is a battery. Plan accordingly.","tags":["Productivity"],"date":"2025-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","body":"There are stretches of time where you feel like you're running on fumes and you can't really explain why. You slept okay. You ate. Nobody yelled at you. But your brain just won't cooperate. You sit down to do something and the gears don't turn. I think a lot of people experience this and chalk it up to laziness or lack of discipline. I used to do the same. But there's a more useful way to think about it. Your brain is a battery Cognitive Load Theory was originally developed by John Sweller in the late 80s as a framework for instructional design. The basic idea is that your working memory can only hold so much at once. When you overload it, performance drops. Learning stops. Decision-making gets worse. But it applies way beyond the classroom. Think of your brain as a battery that starts full in the morning and drains throughout the day. Every decision you make, every piece of information you process, every context switch, every \"where did I put that file\" moment takes a little bit of charge off the battery. The theory breaks cognitive load into three types: Intrinsic load is the difficulty of the thing itself. Some tasks are just hard. You can't avoid this. Extraneous load is the unnecessary friction around the task. Bad tooling, messy folders, unclear instructions, hunting for a bookmark you saved three months ago. This is the stuff you CAN control. Germane load is the good kind. It's the mental effort that goes toward actually learning and understanding. You want to maximize this. The goal is simple: kill as much extraneous load as possible so that when you sit down to do the hard thing, you actually have the capacity for it. The quiet drain Here's what people don't talk about enough. It's rarely one big thing that empties the battery. It's a hundred tiny things. You open your laptop and your desktop is a mess. You need a file but you don't remember where you saved it. You have 47 browser tabs open from three different tasks. Your email inbox is a wall of unread. You need to send a message but you can't find the right Slack channel. You want to reference something you read last week but your bookmarks are a graveyard. None of these things are hard. But each one costs you a tiny decision, a tiny search, a tiny moment of \"wait, where was that again.\" And they add up. By the time you get to the actual work you needed to do, you've already spent half your battery on logistics. Organize before you need to The fix isn't complicated. It's just boring enough that most people don't do it. Your files Pick a folder structure and stick to it. It doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be consistent. When you save something, you should know where it goes without thinking. The moment you have to think about where to put a file, you've already lost a little bit of charge. Your bookmarks Sort them. Folder them. Delete the ones you'll never click again. Your browser bookmarks should work like a library, not a junk drawer. If you reference something regularly, it should be one click away. Your email Folders, labels, filters. Whatever your email client supports, use it. The goal is that when you open your inbox, you see what matters and the rest is already sorted. Inbox Zero isn't about being obsessive. It's about not starting your day with a wall of noise. Your shortcuts Learn the keyboard shortcuts for the tools you use every day. Set up aliases) in your terminal. Create text expansion snippets for things you type often. Every time you reach for the mouse to do something you could have done with a keystroke, that's a micro-drain. One doesn't matter. Fifty a day does. Your phone Turn off notifications for things that aren't urgent. Every buzz is an interruption and every interruption is a context switch. Every context switch costs recovery time. Your phone should be a tool, not a slot machine. Use technology to cover for your brain This is the part where people get weird about productivity tools and I get it. But the point isn't to become some optimization robot. The point is that your brain has limits and technology doesn't. A calendar reminder doesn't forget. A cron job doesn't get tired. A well-organized note system doesn't lose track of things after a long week. Let the machines handle the stuff that machines are good at so your brain can focus on the stuff that only a brain can do. Write things down. Set reminders. Automate what you can. Not because you're broken, but because working memory is genuinely limited to about four things at a time and pretending otherwise is how you end up staring at a screen at 15:00 wondering what you were supposed to be doing. Plan for the low points The battery metaphor is useful because it implies something important: you can plan around it. If you know you're sharpest in the morning, do the hard things in the morning. Save the emails and the admin for the afternoon when your battery is lower. If you know Mondays are rough, don't schedule your most demanding work on a Monday. And when the battery is genuinely empty, stop pretending it isn't. Rest isn't a reward you earn after productivity. It's maintenance. You don't wait until your car breaks down to change the oil. The real point None of this is about being more productive in some grindset sense. It's about being realistic about how your brain works and setting things up so that when the hard moments come, and they always come, you're not already running on empty from a thousand paper cuts. Take care of the small stuff before it piles up. Your future self will thank you."},{"slug":"locked-in-here-with-me","title":"Locked in here with me","excerpt":"A long weekend with work friends at a five star hotel in Lisbon.","tags":["Slice of Life"],"date":"2024-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","body":"My company BlockLabs organized a long weekend for the team in Lisbon. Everyone got their own room at the Epic SANA hotel. Sounds fancy. It kind of was. Settling in I'll be honest, I was a bit nervous going into it. I'm fine with my colleagues on a screen but a full weekend of socializing is a different game. But it turned out to be a really good time. Got to meet friends I'd only seen through webcams, put faces to Slack handles, and just hang out without an agenda for once. The gyro diet I more or less sustained on gyro) kebabs, beer and gin & tonics for the duration of the trip. Not proud, not ashamed. It's a company trip, not a nutrition seminar. Five stars, allegedly Here's a hot take: five star hotels are overrated. I swear the shower beam at the Epic SANA didn't hit as well as the worst one I ever had in Sweden. Breakfast was good though, I'll give them that. The cleaning ladies provided some comedy. One time I was in my room minding my business, eating a gyro by the window, and they just walked in. My pants were tucked away in my luggage so I was standing there in my underwear looking at the view while they went about their business like nothing was happening. Another time they knocked just to hand me a chocolate. No cleaning, just chocolate. I appreciated that. Bar crawls and Rorschach We did bar crawls in costumes. I went as Rorschach) from Watchmen by Alan Moore. Hence the title. The full quote from the comic goes: \"None of you seem to understand. I'm not locked in here with you. You're locked in here with me.\" Felt appropriate for a weekend trapped in a hotel with coworkers. The headache and the maintenance By day two I got hit with a brutal headache that came on late at night. Not alcohol-induced, just one of those ones that shows up uninvited and stays way too long. Had to weather through it. One night I also had to stay in the hotel room to do some site maintenance work, which was a bit dull while everyone else was out. But what can you do. The sites don't fix themselves. In the end I had a good time. It's easy to overthink these kinds of events but once you're there and the gin is flowing and someone's dressed as a superhero stumbling through Lisbon, you realize it's just people being people.

An unexpected reconnection I had just cut my time short with IPTOR following a corporate restructuring. She reached out and we ended up talking about life for a while. What started as a casual check-in turned into a proper friendship. The kind where you actually make plans and follow through on them. Doro lives in Setúbal and we live in Cascais, so when the Ageas CoolJazz Festival was coming up right in our backyard, the three of us figured why not go see AIR). I mean, I knew Sexy Boy I wasn't exactly a die-hard fan going in. I knew Sexy Boy. I knew the vibe. That dreamy French electronic thing that soundtracked a million coffee shop playlists and Sofia Coppola movies. But I hadn't really sat down with a full album. Turns out they were touring the 25th anniversary of Moon Safari and played the whole thing front to back. So I got the full album experience whether I was ready for it or not. The set They opened with La Femme d'argent and as a bass player that opening line just grabbed me immediately. Nicolas Godin apparently recorded that one on a borrowed Höfner and you could really feel it live. Warm, melodic, driving the whole thing forward while the synths floated on top. Sexy Boy hit early and the crowd loved it. Then All I Need came in with this heavier, darker bass tone and I found myself just watching Godin's hands the whole time. Talisman was another one where the bass carried everything. Kelly Watch the Stars, Ce matin-là, the whole album flowed really well live. It sounded bigger and warmer than I expected. After Moon Safari they played some deeper cuts. Cherry Blossom Girl, Venus, Don't Be Light. And they closed with an encore of Alone in Kyoto and Electronic Performers, which honestly might have been the highlight for me. Festival air The Hipódromo in Cascais is a nice venue for this kind of thing. Open air, relaxed crowd, people smoking in the crowd. There was this moment where I was just standing there with a cigarette and the warm night air and this wash of synths and I realized I hadn't been to a proper festival in years. I had sort of \"grown out of it\" at some point. Or at least told myself I had. But it felt really nice to just be out there again. Not in a pit, not losing my mind. Just standing in a crowd with friends, listening to music under the sky. Different energy than what I'm used to, but good. Really good. Sometimes you don't need to be 19 and covered in mud at a metal festival to enjoy live music. Sometimes you just need a warm evening in Cascais and a French duo with a vocoder."},{"slug":"bass-guitar","title":"Got my Bass guitar!","excerpt":"Picking up the bass again and what it taught me about rhythm.","tags":["Slice of Life"],"date":"2024-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","body":"I remember when I was 14 years old. I was raging at how unfair my privileged life was and how \"no-one really understands\" by listening to the latest craze at the time, colloquially defined as \"nu-metal\". Finding the bass One of the biggest bands from that era was KoRn. And my interest had gone so deep that I spent hours looking at live DVDs... which made me look at what the bass player was doing. Now, I was versed enough to know what the bass player did in a band per se... but I found myself being really deeply engrossed in the playing of Fieldy, the bass player for KoRn. I kept on scouring the internet for more clips of bass players and I soon came to the conclusion that I had always resonated with songs that had classic bass lines. My father had raised me well on foundational music like Motown and Deep Purple and all that... so now that I found myself figuring out my own identity it suddenly felt like a calling. I want to be a bass player. So I bothered my parents about it until they gave me an ultimatum. \"If we buy you a bass you need to go to extracurricular music school until you graduate\". Fine with me! The first band Eventually I found a bunch of friends at school that wanted to start a band together and now they were all eager for me to get my equipment. My first bass was a four string J&D with a rosewood fret-board, a tone knob and a volume knob. I plugged this into the 120 Eden Nemesis that my parents also gave me. We figured it would have to be big enough for me to bring to some gigs, you see. By this point the nu-metal craze had died out and the second wave of metalcore was the thing everyone talked about. Bands that regurgitated riffs from Swedish melodic death metal giants such as At The Gates, in other words. Bands like As I Lay Dying), Unearth, Darkest Hour), August Burns Red. I was a huge fan of Norma Jean) and Every Time I Die at the time. But we were a bunch of misfits that got along. Our vocalist was more into the post-hardcore stuff and I was still engrossed in my old nu-metal heroes on top of this new stuff. Our lead guitarist, the insanely talented Erik Rivera, brought all kinds of funny influences from obscure internet bands and we even borrowed some riffs from bands we had yet to really pay proper respect to like Dimmu Borgir and Amon Amarth. We played together for a good couple of years and it was a really good way for me to channel my energy during my most confusing period as a teenager, for sure. You can listen to whatever demos we made at your own risk... remember, we were like 15 years old here. We later disbanded when the drummer decided that he'd rather chase after girls or something... Seedna And it would take all the way until 2013 until the brother of my first girlfriend, Z, wanted to start a band with me. By this point I was really into this Umeå-based post-metal band called Cult of Luna. Lonely, stoic, massive metal music that borrows a lot from metal giants like Neurosis). I bought an old five string Peavey Foundation at a flea market if I remember correctly. Most of my extreme metal heroes played more than four strings, so it felt inevitable. We found two brothers that were kind of into the same thing, we were planning on a release together, they switched up a lot of their focus and one brother in particular wanted us to work according to some plan to render quantifiable results... in the end we bowed out and decided to do something on our own... but I ended up honoring the release made by the band, now titled Seedna, and I have mastering credit for the debut release, Tindalos. Here's a video of me, Z and the other members jamming on the earliest tracks. Going darker After that me and Z decided we wanted to aim for something more menacing. By now I had routed all the way back to my love for hardcore punk (of the regional kind, like the crust punk of M:40 or Grace.Will.Fall) and Z was going all into black metal. We recruited a guitarist, I spent way too much money on recording equipment and practice space expenses and a whole lot of time was invested into turning it into a dream. I bought a vintage Crumar Stringman, a real rarity, to bring some mellotron gloom and Emperor)-vibes to the mix. I also made an honestly stupid investment into a six string Warwick) Corvette bass that I loved oh so very much yet never learned how to play properly. And we refined that dream quite well. Enough to where we had almost the entire cast of former local legends Visio Mortis playing in our band at some point. Losing focus But I had lost my focus. I stopped thinking about developing my skills as a bass player in favor of being this obtuse band leader and producer, and by the time we had some REALLY potent demos... I had practically nothing to show for it. I kept postponing laying down my tracks because whenever I recorded myself I became obsessed with sounding as good as possible. I didn't nail parts and I was unable to play what I heard in my head. I had lost touch with the thing that gave me so much joy in my mid-teens. I attended mixing classes at Nordic Sound Lab, shook hands with some serious players... soldered my own bass pedals... lost track of what mattered, in short. The biggest crime was definitely that the band sustained on seasoned players providing demo tracks, yet we only rehearsed together less than 5 times, because we had aged and people had jobs to tend to. The musicians that accompanied us eventually grew tired and some members joined the ranks of bands like ENVIG, which is a fantastic death metal band with a lot of Bolt Thrower and Entombed) influence. The demos we made are still really really really good though. I hope they'll surface one day. In my dreams we produced and printed that 7 inch and a lot of misunderstood youth got their hands on it. Starting over in Portugal Fast forward, even skipping past the little project I had with a newly found friend, the son of my Beer School-teacher, and Z as per usual... yeah... I was tired of my situation and needed to move to the woman I love. So, naturally, I sold all of my equipment! ...well, I sold what I could and then I gifted the rest to close friends. Once I settled in Portugal and had my first job and a lot of things about my life are not as I'm used to... eventually the itch came back. After my third or so salary I could no longer resist. I bought a tiny little practice amp, the Ibanez Promethean, and then I bought the Ibanez Soundgear SR300E SVM. I returned to four strings because I definitely did most of my years playing one, so finding my way back to it and having this mature intent to get as good as I can at the standard is what fuels me now as I've passed the age of 30. And compared to my biggest musical excursion, the roles were inverse... no one was invested... no one cares... it's just me and my bass. And I can already feel that my best times with this instrument are yet to come."},{"slug":"friends-with-php-again","title":"Friends with PHP Again","excerpt":"I never thought I'd say this, but PHP and I are on good terms again.","tags":["PHP","Developer","Laravel"],"date":"2024-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","body":"I never thought I'd say this, but PHP is genuinely good now. What happened to the JavaScript crowd Let's talk about what's going on in JS land. Because it's a mess. React) introduced Server Components and nobody could agree on what they were for. Next.js went all in on the App Router and broke half the tutorials on the internet. People were fighting about whether to use Pages Router or App Router, or server actions, client components or server components. The docs were rewritten while people were still learning the old way. Meanwhile the rest of the ecosystem kept splintering. Svelte rewrote everything with Runes. Solid exists and is fast but nobody uses it. Astro) carved out a niche for content sites. Remix merged with React Router somehow. Every six months there's a new meta-framework that does what the last one did but with different tradeoffs and a fresh set of breaking changes. The term \"framework fatigue\" has been around for years but it really peaked somewhere around here[^1]. [^1]: If you haven't read \"XML is the future\" by Bite Code, do yourself a favor. It traces how tech keeps repeating the same hype cycles, from XML to NoSQL to microservices to SPAs, and how devs keep falling for it because we think we're too rational to be swayed by marketing. Spoiler: we're not. I watched senior devs with a decade of experience struggle to set up a basic Next.js project because the conventions changed under them. That's not normal. PHP didn't stand still While the JS world was busy reinventing itself, PHP quietly got its act together. PHP 8.3 dropped in November 2023 and it's genuinely modern. We're talking typed class constants, the function, attributes. Go back a few versions and you hit enums, fibers, readonly classes, named arguments, match expressions, union and intersection types. If you stopped paying attention at PHP 5, you'd barely recognize the language. The runtime is fast too. PHP 8 with JIT compilation is seriously competitive. Not \"fast for PHP\" but actually fast. The kind of fast where you stop making excuses. Laravel changed everything But PHP alone wouldn't have pulled me back. Laravel did that. Laravel 10 was already solid, but the ecosystem around it is what really stands out. Taylor Otwell and the team have been on an absolute tear: Livewire 3 dropped and it's a game changer. Full reactive UI components written in PHP. No JavaScript, no build step, no npm. You write a PHP class and a Blade template and you get interactive components that feel like a SPA. For 90% of what people build, you don't need React anymore. Volt takes Livewire further with single-file components. Think Vue's files but in PHP. Your logic and template live in the same file. Folio brings file-based routing to Laravel. Drop a Blade file in the right folder and it's a route. Just like Next.js but without the twelve layers of abstraction. Laravel Herd is a native dev environment for Mac and Windows. One-click PHP setup, no Docker, no Homebrew, no config files. It just works. Pint handles code formatting. Think Prettier but for PHP, opinionated and zero-config. And Laravel 11 is right around the corner with a slimmed-down skeleton, per-second cron scheduling, and health check routing built in. The DX is actually great now What really surprised me is how good the developer experience got. The days of clunky commands and cryptic error pages are over. Laravel now ships with: Laravel Breeze and Jetstream for auth scaffolding that actually looks good Telescope for debugging requests, queries, jobs, mail, everything Horizon for queue monitoring with a beautiful dashboard Real error pages via Ignition that show you exactly what went wrong, with suggested fixes The tooling around it is mature. Spatie alone has published hundreds of packages that cover everything from media handling to permissions to backup. The ecosystem is deep in a way that JS frameworks just aren't. Why this matters I'm not here to start a language war. I still write JavaScript. I still like TypeScript. I built this blog with Astro. But there's something to be said for a stack where you can build a full app with auth, database, queues, email, API, admin panel, and deploy it on a $5 server without touching a single line of JavaScript. No webpack. No nodemodules. No hydration. No \"use client\". Just PHP, a database, and you're done. PHP isn't a joke anymore. It might actually be the most practical language for building web apps right now. And I say that as someone who spent years making fun of it. My latest PHP project To put my money where my mouth is, I recently built a WordPress plugin called TeamTailor Integrator. It syncs job listings from TeamTailor into WordPress as custom post types, maps their departments and locations to taxonomies, and keeps everything in sync with a cron job. SEO-friendly markup out of the box. Nothing fancy. Just a well-structured plugin that talks to an API, stores data properly, and does its job without breaking. That's the kind of thing PHP is really good at, and the kind of thing that would have taken me twice as long with a JS stack and a database adapter and a build step and a deployment pipeline and... you get the idea."},{"slug":"yes-i-meditate","title":"Yes, I Meditate (3/3)","excerpt":"On getting into meditation and what it actually does for me.","tags":["Slice of Life","Health","Productivity"],"date":"2024-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","body":"Yes, I meditate. Getting past the stigma I completely understand most people that fall into the camps of either thinking that it's pretentious or the people that are wishing that they got enough utility out of it to continue after \"that one time they tried\". For me it was mostly things falling into place. I was past my 20's and still figuring life out. I had been talking more with my dad at the time and he gave me some simple, non-pretentious self-help stuff like \"Getting organized\" and whatnot. I sifted through that stuff as he was about to throw it away. I found a lot of readings highlighted with meditation. I never took my dad as a guy that would do that, but we're also an open-minded family and I have found a lot of relief in things like the Yantra mat... understanding full and well that it's just \"safe self-harm for cheap endorphins\" at the end of the day. It never stuck before I bet I must have tried to meditate or relax in school a bunch of times or after seeing some anthropological documentary about monks somewhere... but like most people reading this it just never stuck. It was too tied to the notion of religion or explicit spirituality. The benefits were never laid out for me clearly enough. Finding the right format But then I sort of found myself with some podcasts, like a lot of people do, while walking home one night. Fairly sure it wasn't a Sam Harris podcast specifically, though Sam Harris has certainly become the face of secular, non-religious meditation in recent years. I started with Headspace). It was this app with a calm male British voice. Back then it had quite a lot of recordings that it provided for free before it decided to pull tighter to make more revenue. For a while I used his Waking Up) app after getting \"a scholarship\". That's what Sam Harris calls the free trial he gives out to people who can't justify dropping 90€ on meditation recordings. I'm no longer pursuing that route, but it served its purpose at the time. What it actually does for me The simple formatting made it easy to stick with. And in my most committed periods I definitely felt the benefits: Mental clarity Emotional resilience Fewer moments of intense negative emotion Greater focus Better sleep Better memory Keeping at it I'm not perfect about it... throughout tougher periods in a year I might dip out. But I know how much it helps me and I intend to keep the habit up because of it. Resources If you're looking for a free, no-strings-attached way to get started, I'd strongly recommend Medito. It's a non-profit, fully free meditation app with a solid library of guided sessions: no subscription tiers, no scholarship workarounds, just a clean and honest tool. The foundation's mission is to make meditation accessible to everyone regardless of income, which sits well with me. It covers the basics well and is a great entry point if you don't want to commit to a paid platform before you even know if it sticks."},{"slug":"commonplace-notes-2025","title":"Commonplace Notes (2/3)","excerpt":"A look at my commonplace note-taking system heading into 2025.","tags":["Productivity"],"date":"2024-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","body":"In my last post I went on about organized markdown notes, or rather, Obsidian, in my current case. Digital doesn't cover everything But it doesn't REALLY solve every situation. You can't always sit and type into structured notes knowing exactly where your thoughts are supposed to go. So I started looking into alternatives. A lot of people are comfortable doing this kind of thing in Obsidian too. A lot of people do things like Zettelkasten, and if you don't know what that is there's a Wiki for it. Just get a notebook But what works for me is just having a notebook handy. And just like my approach to never forgetting my wallet or my keys... I find it helpful if it's hefty, substantial, and singular. I don't want to suddenly realize that \"oh I didn't write that down in THIS notebook\"... not everybody works like this, but I see it as me sticking to the K.I.S.S-principle. The Milimetrado 1000 I have one notebook. In my case it's almost comedically big. I have the Milimetrado 1000 Pages. It really does have 1000 pages. It has \"bible thin\" pages that take surprisingly well to most pens, pencil or otherwise. How I actually use it My process is honestly very simple. I jot down sketches, mind-maps, tons and tons of bullet lists for things I need to deal with or structure up later. Anything I need out of my head and into something I can go through at a later time. Another name for a commonplace notebook is a brain dump, and that's really all it is. It comes with a nifty little bookmark built into it, so you always know where the next fresh page is. That's about all I need from my notes, personally. It goes with me wherever I need to be for more than 5 hours. Some days I just switch it up between checking boxes in the notebook and doing so in my Obsidian notes. The brain likes novelty, and switching things up keeps it from feeling like a chore."},{"slug":"obsidian","title":"Obsidian (1/3)","excerpt":"My Obsidian setup and how it ties into everything else.","tags":["Productivity"],"date":"2024-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","body":"There are so many ways to get organized, aren't there? The productivity trap People have been trying to capitalize on selling the single best universal solution that will make you an unstoppable force of productivity. \"No more procrastination, EVER!\" Yeah... I don't believe all that either. And there are even things to be said about allowing your brain to be your primary filter in life. Whatever does not stick might simply not interest you enough. However... Why journaling matters There is nothing wrong at all with journaling. There's countless studies since time eternal pointing at the fact that it helps people with taking themselves more seriously and it also helps a whole lot with staying organized with all of the things that you don't have social or monetary incentives to do. There are a lot of those in life. The search for the right tool I looked at several alternatives, got caught in the trappings of how niche and cool and geeky some things were, like Org mode for Emacs (for all you hardcore programmers out there) or things like Joplin). I dabbled a fair bit with \"wanting to blog\" as if people wanted to read about me doing my laundry and crying in front of Band of Brothers) on a Saturday morning. Eventually I found Obsidian. Obsidian is not perfect It's not Free and Open Source software by definition. It's attached to a subscription service owned by a private company. But they've admittedly had a good run and the people responsible are very invested in simply creating a product that lasts. And if you don't want to sync files using their service there's nothing to stop you from doing it on your own. Some people even use Git repositories! And learning to take simple notes using the Markdown language standard is what is the most important part of all this. Obsidian just so happens to allow users to have excellent visual improvements for the varying means with which we can format said documents. Making it my own Obsidian HAS a well defined structure and an extensive \"means to approach certain kinds of notes\"... I found it easier to use this opportunity to program my own means of interacting and extracting value from my notes. That project became ~~Obsitica~~ Habsiad! What is Habsiad? Habsiad is my Obsidian plugin. It's a bridge between Obsidian and Habitica, the gamified habit tracker. But calling it just a bridge sells it short. It's really a full productivity suite that sits inside Obsidian and gives structure to daily journaling. The core idea is simple: Habitica is great at tracking habits, dailies, and to-dos. But it doesn't store your progress over time. You check things off and they vanish. Habsiad fixes that by pulling your completed habits and dailies from Habitica into your Obsidian journal entries, where they become permanent records you can actually look back on and visualize. And here's the thing: you don't even need Habitica to use it. Habsiad works just fine on its own with its built-in Retrotagger, which lets you manually log your habits and dailies directly inside any journal entry. How I use it day to day Every morning I open today's journal note (more on how that works below) and it's already templated with sections for work, food tracking, to-dos, and reflections. Throughout the day I fill things in as they happen. At the end of the day I hit and Habsiad pulls in everything I checked off in Habitica. Meals tracked, workout done, steps logged, book reading noted. All of it lands in my journal as structured data stored in the frontmatter. That frontmatter is key. It turns qualitative \"I had a good day\" entries into quantitative data I can graph over weeks and months. What you can track Out of the box, Habsiad supports tracking: Habits and Dailies from Habitica (or manually via the Retrotagger) Steps from whatever fitness app you use (Google Fit, Samsung Health, Zepp Life, etc.) Weight in kilograms for trend tracking Calories with automatic summation from meal tables in your notes Alcohol consumption by scanning for drink-related emojis in your entries Anything you want via the Labels system, where you tag things with emojis like or and Habsiad aggregates the data Labels This is probably my favorite feature. You can track literally anything by putting an emoji and a number anywhere in your journal entry: Habsiad scans all your entries and gives you a chronological rundown of any label you click on. No setup, no configuration. Just write naturally and the data shows up. Logs Another one I use constantly. You can create specialized logs using Obsidian's callout syntax: Habsiad collects all logs of the same type across your journal and presents them chronologically. Great for dream journals, workout logs, meeting notes, whatever pattern you want to track over time. The plugins that make it all click Habsiad doesn't exist in a vacuum. There are three community plugins that I consider essential companions. Calendar The Calendar plugin by Liam Cain puts a simple calendar in your sidebar. Click any date and it opens (or creates) that day's journal note. It's the front door to the whole journaling workflow. Without it you'd be manually creating files named every day, and nobody wants that. Tracker The Tracker plugin by pyrochlore is what turns all that frontmatter data into graphs. All those values Habsiad stores (steps, weight, habits completed, calories, custom labels) become line charts, bar graphs, and summaries. This is where the long-term payoff lives. Weeks of daily logging suddenly become visible trends. Emoji Toolbar The Emoji Toolbar plugin by oliveryh makes the Labels feature actually practical. Instead of hunting for the right emoji every time you want to log something, you get a quick picker. Small quality of life thing, but it matters when you're trying to make journaling as frictionless as possible. Why I built it I built Habsiad because I wanted one place where everything about my day could live. Not scattered across five apps. Not locked behind some service's API. Just Markdown files on my computer that happen to be really well structured. The fact that it bridges to Habitica is a bonus for people who like the gamification angle. But the real value is in the journal structure, the data it captures, and the fact that it's all yours, stored locally, forever."},{"slug":"moved-to-portugal","title":"Moved to Portugal","excerpt":"We packed up and left Sweden for Lisbon.

I stumbled upon Margarida's posts in this group and one day I just decided to write to her out of the blue. \"Slide into her DMs\" as the kids say these days.

And eventually I decided that what I needed was to move out from my parents' place to really get some skin in the game with my job search... and that's when she sent me a book and a love letter. Around that time I knew that I had to at least take it seriously. And she eventually got on a plane and met me in Gothenburg by the bus terminal, we had a Heineken at Mr.Chu's... and then she got on the train with me to Lidköping and we've been a force to reckon with ever since. I blew savings on plane tickets. We weathered Covid together. I want to live with this woman. The logistics But we've made things complicated for each other, being that she is a Portuguese native and that I am from little Lidköping in Sweden. We measured the chances of getting established professionally for both... turns out Sweden is quite horrible when it comes to transferring credentials across EU borders for the profession of law. Norway even had 8 spots available...Sweden only really had one, and it'd require that Margarida switched up focus and then did a master's to even have a shot at it. But what about me? This many years since being a complete nobody, I had forged a career as a web developer. I've been fluent in English since my earliest years in school, one of few pure talents. I guess I'm moving to Portugal. Making the jump So, here I am. 8 years into my job. A lot of coworkers had left the small town I was working in, who I am coincidentally from. What am I waiting for? So I took about 1½ years of intense studying to really feel like I'd be able to face the international market. And then I made a CV so comfortable that I'd be able to sound authentic during interviews. First interview was for one of those gigs where you would have to look at flagged materials. Hours were terrible. Pay even worse. I skipped. But already at my second opportunity I had the fortune of talking to a really kind Ukrainian/Bulgarian recruiter named Tereza. She offered me a position as a \"Senior WordPress Developer\" that would be attached to a marketing team. I aced the initial interview and then during the technical interview I spoke to two German gentlemen and they asked me about my prior experience and gave me the thumbs up. I could barely believe it myself. Packing up But then came the logistics of it all. They needed me to quickly fly down to Portugal, register myself and provide those credentials. So in three weeks' time I had packed/sold/thrown every single belonging until all I owned could be reduced to what would fit in an XL trolley and a blue 80L backpack. And then I went on my flight. Ended up in Lisbon, as a fair amount of times before. But I'm not going back to stay in Sweden this time around. This is the beginning of my new chapter in life."}]
